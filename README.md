# C_Files
A few of the more functional/applicable C files I wrote while I was learning the the basics of the language.

Wanted to get a little foundation with a mid-level language, so I chose to learn a little bit of C.
Being aware of things like memory allocation and speed is important to know.

Just a few files demonstrating my understanding of the syntax and basic mechanics of this language. 

**UPDATE**

I'm using C for HPC. Still keeping the couple of "hey I learned super intro stuff" just because. But yeah, more hardcore parallel C code being thrown in here now.
